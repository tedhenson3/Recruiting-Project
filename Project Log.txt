Recruiting Project Log

First Weekend
Got 247 scraper working
basketball reference scraper started


January 14

Discovered scraping rivals may be difficult
Got basketball reference scraper to work for 1 url to get bio info.
#Noted how the urls change based on weird players

Got players teams from ESPN site with selector gadget
Learned the hard lesson again that scraping without selector gadget is probably not worth it! 

Scraper for ESPN working for 100 players in 2017 :)
#issue fixed for when a player did not go to a school


January 15
Created player Id's for 247 and espn which link to basketball reference
Need to create a catch all standard mapping from 247/espn to basketball reference, as of right now there are too many exceptions and not enough rules
#Need to control for a "John Smith" that has been at many different schools, maybe even the same school
