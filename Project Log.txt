Recruiting Project Log

First Weekend
Got 247 scraper working
basketball reference scraper started


January 14

Discovered scraping rivals may be difficult
Got basketball reference scraper to work for 1 url to get bio info.
#Noted how the urls change based on weird players

Got players teams from ESPN site with selector gadget
Learned the hard lesson again that scraping without selector gadget is probably not worth it! 

Scraper for ESPN working for 100 players in 2017 :)
#issue fixed for when a player did not go to a school


January 15
Created player Id's for 247 and espn which link to basketball reference
Need to create a catch all standard mapping from 247/espn to basketball reference, as of right now there are too many exceptions and not enough rules
Merge espn and 247 data by name
#Need to control for a "John Smith" that has been at many different schools, maybe even the same school 

Succesfully merged espn and 247
#note sometimes player uses jr, sometimes they do not
#note a name like troy brown could have up to 5 players in cbb reference


January 15
Use contains/substring function to match ids from 247 and espn

Use players college to validate that it is the correct player, their state, year, too?


January 16
Realized keeping just espn name for now should work.
completed: need to remove leading blanks in espn.247 dataset
successfully added basketball reference bio info to dataset

next time: 
need to get win share info and other stats from bball reference
try catch part not working (lonnie-walker-1 not being changed to lonnie-walker-2)
need to return nothing when player has no stats (brian burns ii)

January 17
Successfully teased out bad links from good links
Still need to control for pulling the wrong player (Wendell Carter Jr.)
