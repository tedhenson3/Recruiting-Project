# Recruiting Project #
I am attempting to predict college basketball performance based on recruiting data and high school statistics.
This project will be my senior honors thesis sponsored by Dr. Mario Giacomazzo.
I am planning on submitting my paper in competitions such as the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference research competition in 2020.
